# Rails One Click Install for Mac Os X (10.6 or higher)

Rails One Click is the perfect tool  for installing and managing rails
applications.

Rails One Click is targeted at beginner who have little or no
programming experience, or to developers who want to try rails but don't
want to bother about installing ruby and managing dependencies.

Rails one click creates a sandboxed Ruby environment accessible within
the app. When you're ready to move on simply delete the directory
created by Rails One Click.

### Project Status: ALPHA

This software is not ready for beginners, yet. However, the basic
functionalities are already there.

If you can, please test the installation process in your system.

### Ruby sandbox

Ruby is installed inside Documents/rails_one_click. That way if you ever
mess up with something you'll just need to delete the ruby directory inside
that folder.

### How to run it

Right now, download the xcode project, build and run and follow
instructions!
